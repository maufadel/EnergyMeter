class EnergyMeter:
    """
    The consumption of each component is measured as follows:

    - CPU: the energy consumption of the CPU is measured with RAPL via the pyRAPL
        library. RAPL is an API from Intel, which is also semi-compatible with
        AMD. RAPL on Intel has been shown to be accurate thanks to the usage of
        embedded sensors in the processor and memory while AMD uses performance
        counters and is therefore, not so accurate.

    - DRAM: the energy used by the memory is also measure with RAPL via pyRAPL.
        This might not be available for AMD processors and pre-Haswell Intel
        processors. You can find more info here:
        https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2989081.2989088.

    - GPU: we measure the energy consumption of the GPU with nvidia-smi. For this, we
        run a separate thread that samples the power draw of the GPU while the meter
        is running. We then calculate the mean of this and multiply it by the 
        duration of the meter.

    - Disk: we cannot directly measure the energy consumption of the disk in the same
        way that we do for the other components, so we have implemented an bpftrace
        probe that tracks all the bytes read and written to disk. This probe is run 
        as a separate thread inside EnergyMeter. We then calculate the energy 
        consumption with the following formulae:
        disk_active_time = (bytes_read + bytes_written) / DISK_SPEED
        disk_idle_time = total_meter_time - disk_active_time
        total_energy = disk_active_time * DISK_ACTIVE_POWER +
                        disk_idle_time * DISK_IDLE_POWER
        Note that you are required the provide the parameters DISK_SPEED,
        DISK_ACTIVE_POWER and DISK_IDLE_POWER.
